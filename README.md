ComplyTime leverages [OSCAL](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/) to perform compliance assessment activities, using plugins for each stage of the lifecycle.

### Basic Usage

Determine the baseline you want to run a scan for and create an OSCAL [Assessment Plan](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/concepts/layer/assessment/assessment-plan/). The Assessment
Plan will act as configuration to guide the ComplyTime generation and scanning operations.

```bash
complytime list
...
# Table appears with options. Look at the Framework ID column.
```

```bash
complytime plan <framework-id>
...
# The file will be written out to assessment-plan.json in the specified workspace.
# Defaults to current working directory.

cat assessment-plan.json
# The default assessment-plan.json will be available in the complytime workspace (complytime/assessment-plan.json).

complytime plan <framework-id> --dry-run 
# See the default contents of the assessment-plan.json.

complytime plan <framework-id> --dry-run --out config.yml
# Customize the assessment-plan.json with the "out" flag. Updates can be made in the config.yml. 

complytime plan <framework-id> --with-config config.yml
# The config.yml will be loaded when passing "with-config" to customize the assessment-plan.json. 
```

Run the generate command to `generate` policy artifacts in the workspace and run the `scan` command to execute the generated artifacts and get results.

```bash
complytime generate
...
complytime scan

# The results will be written to assessment-results.json in the specified workspace.
# Defaults to current working directory under folder "complytime".

complytime scan --with-md

# Both assessment-results.md and assessment-results.json will be written in the specified workspace.
# Defaults to current working directory under folder "complytime".
```
